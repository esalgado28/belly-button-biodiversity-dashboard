Here, I built an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset, which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.
The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

- The data in *samples.json* is read using the D3 library
- Plotly is used to generate the charts
- The main script is *app.js*
- *bonus.js* handles the bonus objective which was to create a gauge chart

The app is deployed to GitHub Pages:  https://esalgado28.github.io/belly-button-biodiversity-dashboard/
